										<h2 class="major">Thermomechanical Analysis</h2>
										<p>I have worked extensively on thermomechanical analyses of cylinder heads and blocks. The combustion face for cylinder heads has to be designed such that
											it is capable of sustaining the high temperatures that it is subjected to. If the temperatures exceed a certain threshold, cracks start developing in 
											the combustion face that can cause serious warranty issues. I have worked on designing and analyzing diesel, natural gas, and fuel cell engines to meet the temperature
											requirements. I am proficient at analyzing steady-state and transient thermal conditions in Ansys Workbench. I piloted the transient thermal analysis process for cylinder heads 
											and gaskets using combustion CFD and coolant CFD domains. I regularly collaborate with CFD analysts who work on Converge CFD and Ansys Fluent. I delivered a 35 deg. C reduction in 
											combustion face temperatures for a heavy-duty diesel engine as compared to the baseline product by modifying the water jacket design to target hot areas and by optimizing the coolant flow.

										<h2 class="major">Modal and Stress Analysis</h2>
										<p> As part of my current role, I have to regularly analyze different components for stress and deformation under specific loading conditions. The load application 
											requirements for different components vary based on their specific duty cycle and application. For instance, for a cylinder head or a block, the worst-case loads 
											come from the combustion firing loads and thermal stresses. On the other hand, a component like a flywheel housing is more likely to fail from transportation loads. For 
											a stationary energy unit like a Solid Oxide Fuel Cell power generator, some of the critical loads come from seismic and wind loads. I regularly work on various engines  
											and components to formulate different loading and boundary conditions that make physical sense. Since I work on NPI programs, more often than not, the analysis procedures
											and pass/fail criteria have to be curated to reduce the ambiguity of the results.

										<h2 class="major">Engine Accessory Design</h2>
										<p>I have designed auxiliary engine components like oil pans, flywheel housings and lifting brackets in the Current Product space. I curated the Design Verification Plan and Report (DVP&R) for various
											components based on the changes that were being made to the design. I also have experience with designing plumbing options such as coolant lines and oil suction tubes.
											I have employed DFA and DFM principles while working on these designs. I am also familiar with Failure Mode and Effects Analysis (FMEA) and Root Cause Analysis procedures.
